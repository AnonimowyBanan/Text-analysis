# Text-analysis
A simple text analysis program that allows you to enter text by specifying a filename that is in the same location as main.py.
The program allows you to:
- counting the number of words in the text
- counting the number of sentences in the text
- finding unique words in the text
- calculation of the percentage share of the 10 most frequently occurring words in the text

Necessary to run the program are:
- Python 3.7 or newer
- package Typer (`pip install typer`)

How to run program:
Once I have installed all the necessary packages, you need to move the text file to the same location as the executable file.

Then launch a terminal and type:
`python main.py "your file name".txt`

For example:
`python main.py test.txt`
